This was the third part of a 3 part series of assignments that started with creating a Java program that would read a deterministic finite automata, then a deterministic pushdown automata, 
and finally this program is meant to read a TM from a text file with a specified format--i knew line 1 would have the start state, 2 would be the accept state, and 3 would be the reject state, 4 would be the tape alphabet, and so on. 

TM1 and TM2 were files from the professor, and Cox_TM3 was one I was to create on my own.
TM3 accepts any strings that begin with an even amount of 1s or 2s.
